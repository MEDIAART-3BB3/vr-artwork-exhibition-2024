    <h1> Elysium by Wilson Cheng & Braydon Tress </h1>
    <p>
      Elysium, takes place in a post-apocalyptic world of our own making. The scenario questions society whether it is worth it to leave behind reality (symbolizing the everyday struggle and potential for growth) and to indulge in Elysium (symbolizing a haven that prohibits any potential for growth in exchange for perpetual joy). Here is an exception from Travis, who values the strength of humanity:

“Why does life slumber? It's a question every soul must reckon with, for no two answers are the same. Do we see it as a reward for all our toil? A place to escape the hardships of life? For those who were unable to fulfill their deepest desires; they can do so in dreams. Elysium is damn persuasive, that's for sure.

It is the year 2998—New Star Calendar, year 327. The world we knew was ravaged by war and strife. A self-proclaimed saviour from the stars descended and promised us perpetual bliss in exchange for something far greater. Perhaps many prefer it this way, but what do I know? I'm just a terrorist in the eyes of Elysium, a distant voice trying to wake the dead.

Yet, there’s one truth that not even Elysium can erase. Struggle and hardship force us to grow, to become better. And if we’ve no say in how we live, then tell me, what is life? We will not be blinded by their deception. The right to rebel is ours, as long as we draw breath.” — Travis, Rebel Armed Forces
